	<h2>1. Question</h2>
    <p>This project is aimed at analyzing the trend of unemployment rate in USA since the financial crisis in 2008 and the recovery of employment in different states.</p>
	<h2>2.Description </h2>
	<p><strong>2.1. Data</strong></p>

    <p>The national monthly unemployment rates can be found at <a href="https://data.bls.gov/pdq/SurveyOutputServlet">https://data.bls.gov/pdq/SurveyOutputServlet</a></p>
    <p>And data for States can be found at <a href="https://www.bls.gov/web/laus/lauhsthl.htm#lauhsthl.f.p.">https://www.bls.gov/web/laus/lauhsthl.htm#lauhsthl.f.p.</a></p>
    <p><strong>2.2. Charts</strong></p>
    <p>Three charts are generated to illustrate above questions.</p>
    <p><strong>1) </strong>The first chart is a scatterplot. It shows national unemployment rates from Jan 2008 to May 2018. During the financial crisis, the unemployment rate continued going up and this trend still lasted in 2009. The unemployment rate peaked at the end of 2009. Then the unemployment rate continued to decline until today. The current unemployment rate is lower than before the fiancial crisis.  </p>

    <p><strong>2) </strong>The second chart is a map. It shows the recent unemployment rates by States in April 2018. A continuous blue palette is used to distinguish states of different unemployment rates. The deeper the color, the higher the unemployment rate. You can see the detailed value when you put the mouse over the map. Hawaii, New Hampshire and North Dakota have the lowest unemployment rates.

    <p><strong>3) </strong>The third chart is also a map. It shows the average annual change of unemployment rates by States from April 2010 to April 2018, which are calculated based on the unemployment rate data. A continuous orange palette is used to distinguish states of different changes. The deeper the color, the higher the drop of unemployment rate and the faster the recovery of employment. You can see the detailed value when you put the mouse over the map. Nevada, Michigan and California have the fastest recovery.
